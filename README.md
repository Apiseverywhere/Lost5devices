# Lost5devices
Hacked intially via cloud console, tho they had my mail and pw. I just found a trace leading to console where someone was admin in my name/mail, and managed to install 3 projects mostly of loggers and remote view/control. Contacted google,(paid for fast service=ripoff), Samsung, Motorola, proton(paid upgrade again) and ISP. Even my tv now


hacked 15times on this acc making this

back again, tho i never wanted to be here ðŸ¥´ðŸ¥´
had my banking contact mails set to mails i havent used in years even. i know you're here, Tom, the useless genious.
i have alot of logs, many lost, but it's all just fun for mr ex-kaspersky, atleast behind the keyboard.
changing settings, locked two unused devices, tab a8, and S23+ is useless "locked to owner". 
This has cost me alot by now, the a-hole had 5 BLE connections to my tv, and i found some mac leading to a Bluetooth sender days ago. 
Phones, mails, IMEI, # all changed, but 1-3 hours later he's back.
Moron spent xmas eve closing my tabs..
Been many places, does anyone have a good tip?
Dont know what files to add so please ask.
Some would say bounty, i'd say any definite proof is very decisive for many.
