Hacked intially via cloud console, tho they had my mail and pw. I just found a trace leading to console where someone was admin in my name/mail, and managed to install 3 projects mostly of loggers and remote view/control. Contacted google,(paid for fast service=ripoff), Samsung, Motorola, proton(paid upgrade again) and ISP. Even my tv now
